This is a Web Exercise template created by the [psychology teaching team at the University of Glasgow](http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk), based on ideas by [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). This template enables instructors to easily create web documents that students can use in self-assessment.

The webex package provides a number of functions that you use in [inline R code](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) to create HTML widgets (text boxes, pull down menus, buttons that reveal hidden content). Examples are provided in this document. Knit this file to HTML to see how it works.

**NOTE: To use the widgets in the compiled HTML file, you need to have a JavaScript-enabled browser. The widgets don't work in the built-in RStudio browser. In the built-in browser, click the "Open in Browser" button to open the file in your operating system's browser.**

## Fill-In-The-Blanks (`fitb()`)

Create fill-in-the-blank questions using `fitb()`, providing the answer as the first argument.

- 2 + 2 is `r fitb("4")`

You can also create these questions dynamically, using variables from your R session.

```{r echo = FALSE}
x <- sample(2:8, 1)
```

- The square root of `r x^2` is: `r fitb(x)`

The blanks are case-sensitive; if you don't care about case, use the argument `ignore_case = TRUE`.

- What is the letter after D? `r fitb("E", ignore_case = TRUE)`

If you want to ignore differences in whitespace use, use the argument `ignore_ws = TRUE` and include spaces in your answer anywhere they could be acceptable..

- How do you load the tidyverse package? `r fitb("library( tidyverse )", ignore_case = TRUE, width = "20")`

You can set more than one possible correct answer by setting the answers as a vector.

- Type a vowel: `r fitb(c("A", "E", "I", "O" , "U"), ignore_case = TRUE)`

## Multiple Choice (`mcq()`)

- "Never gonna give you up, never gonna: `r mcq(c("let you go", "turn you down", "run away", answer = "let you down"))`"
- "I `r mcq(c(answer = "bless the rains", "guess it rains", "sense the rain"))` down in Africa" -Toto

## True or False (`torf()`)

- You can permute values in a vector using `sample()`. `r torf(TRUE)`

## Hidden solutions and hints (`hide()` and `unhide()`)

- Recreate the scatterplot below, using the built-in `cars` dataset.

```{r echo = FALSE}
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))
```

`r hide("I need a hint")`
`?plot`
`r unhide()`

`r hide()`
```{r eval = FALSE}
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))
```
`r unhide()`

*Don't forget to `unhide()` after the solution!*
