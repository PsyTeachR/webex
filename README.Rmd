# The webex package

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PsyTeachR/misc/master/img/webex.001.png" style="float:right; max-width:280px; width: 25%;" />

The goal of webex is to enable instructors to easily create interactive web pages that students can use in self-guided learning. Although webex has fewer features than RStudio's [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package, it is more lightweight: whereas learnr tutorials must be either hosted on a shiny server or run locally, webex creates standalone HTML files that require only a JavaScript-enabled browser. It is also extremely simple to use.

## Installation

You can install webex from CRAN using:

```{r install-cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("webex")
```

You can install the development version of webex from [GitHub](https://github.com/PsyTeachR/webex) with:

```{r install-webex, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("psyteachr/webex")
```

## Creating interactive widgets with inline code

The webex package provides functions that create HTML widgets using [inline R code](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).  These functions are:

| function                | widget         | description                    |
|:------------------------|:---------------|:-------------------------------|
| `fitb()`                | text box       | fill-in-the-blank question     |
| `mcq()`                 | pull-down menu | multiple choice question       |
| `torf()`                | pull-down menu | TRUE or FALSE question         |
| `hide()` and `unhide()` | button         | solution revealed when clicked |
| `total_correct()`       | text           | updating total correct         |

The appearance of the text box and pull-down menu widgets changes when users enter the correct answer. Answers can be either static or dynamic (i.e., specified using R code). Widget styles can be changed using `style_widgets()`.

Examples are provided in the **Web Exercises** R Markdown template. To create a file from the webex template in RStudio, click `File -> New File... -> RMarkdown` and in the dialog box that appears, select `From Template` and choose `Web Exercises`.

Alternatively (or if you're not using RStudio) use:

```{r compile-webex, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("exercises.Rmd", "webex", "webex")
```

Knit the file to HTML to see how it works. **Note: The widgets only function in a JavaScript-enabled browser. The RStudio built-in browser does not have JavaScript. Click the "Open in Browser" button to use your operating system's browser.**
